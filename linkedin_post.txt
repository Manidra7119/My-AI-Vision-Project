I just built an AI that can recognize pictures like cats, dogs, and airplanes! 🐱✈️ Using Python and TensorFlow in Google Colab, I trained two models: a custom CNN (69.14% accuracy) and a smarter MobileNetV2 (31.21% accuracy). Check out my project on GitHub: https://github.com/Manidra7119/My-AI-Vision-Project! So excited to learn about AI and computer vision! 🚀 #AI #MachineLearning #ComputerVision
